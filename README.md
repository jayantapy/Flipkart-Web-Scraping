* Here, I scraped a Flipkart page to get details about the laptops with 8 GB of RAM. 
The web scraping is done in two ways:
1. In 1st method, I haven't used any external libraries to do the web scraping.
2. In 2nd method, I used *Beautiful Soup* for pulling the data out of HTML and XML files.

After getting the data in proper format, I searched the details of all the laptops such as Product Name,Price,Description and Rating. 
Finally, I extracted all the laptops with 8 GB of RAM, and added all these features in a new dataframe.
